# O-Atop
Due to Android introducing a "tombstone mode" similar to iOS, conventional tools like top and htop are no longer sufficient for the latest Android Linux background and power consumption monitoring.
O-Atop implements application self-startup detection, OOM background kill detection, memory monitoring, power consumption monitoring, tombstone status monitoring, and other functions on the Android platform.

## Useage

```bash
su # please make sure that you have been granted root permissions
chmod +x O-Atop
./O-Atop
```
